# Coding-Challenge2-ISM3232

In this Coding Challenge, I will be developing an application that will streamline and make easier for the customers of a restaurant the process of splitting their bills. It will be able to calculate how much each person has to pay of the bill with tips included taking into considerations the usual amount people tip in that region.
